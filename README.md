# py-deckcards-generator

<b>A note from the owner of this repository:</b>

The original purpose  of this program was to be able to parse a set of definitions and create study cards you can sort by subject, study level and other categories I just can't remember now.

Since it has been two years now from the original intent of create this project and because it has been without any updates whatsoever I have decided to look around to another place and stop temporary this project. I want to explore places I know it would be easy to create study cards such as quiznet or some api that I prob. would take advantage from.

Until the aforemention take place this repository would be inactive and will get back once I have a better plan for this project.

If you want to be in touch please open an issue and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Thank you, will see you all around soon.
